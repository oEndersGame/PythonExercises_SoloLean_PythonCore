# Problem:
'''
Sets are created using curly braces and they hold unique values.

Given two sets, find and output all the elements that are common to both sets.
For example, for the following sets:
{'a', 'b', 'c'}
{'c', 'd', 'e'}

The output should be {'c'}, as it is present in both sets.

NOTE: The output should be a set, containing the common elements.
