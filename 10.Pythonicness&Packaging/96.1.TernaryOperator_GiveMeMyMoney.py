# Problem:
'''
You are given a program for a bank card withdrawal system: it takes the account and the amount that the user wants to withdraw, then outputs the remaining money. If the requested cash is greater than the balance, the program outputs "Error".
The bank wants to set a minimal value of $500 for withdrawal. Modernize the program so that it will output the same "Error" if the requested money is less than $500.

Sample Input:
4500
300

Sample Output:
Error

NOTE: As with other operators, you can chain multiple conditions with the ternary operator.

# CODE:

balance = int(input())
to_cash = int(input())

#change the code
money_left = balance-to_cash if to_cash<=balance and to_cash >= 500 else "Error"

print(money_left)
