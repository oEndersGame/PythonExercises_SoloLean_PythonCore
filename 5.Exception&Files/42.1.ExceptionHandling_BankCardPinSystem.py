# Problem:
'''
We need to create a program that allows users to create their own PIN codes for their bank cards. Each PIN code consists of digits. Complete the program so that when the user enters a character, the program stops and outputs "Please enter a number" and when the user enters only digits, the program outputs "PIN code is created".

Sample Input:
44a5
Sample Output:
Please enter a number

NOTE: Recall int() function, that occurs an error when the argument is not a number.

# CODE:

pin = input()
try:
    int(pin)
    print("PIN code is created")

except ValueError:

    print("Please enter a number")
