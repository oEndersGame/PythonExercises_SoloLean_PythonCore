We need to calculate the area of the rectangle.
Complete and call the function to output the area of the rectangle, taking 2 arguments as length and width. If sides are equal, the function should also show "Square" as the second output.

Sample Input 1:

# CODE:

length = int(input())
width = int(input())


def area(length, width):
    if length == width:
        print(length * width)
        print("Square")
    else:
        print(length * width)


area(length, width)
