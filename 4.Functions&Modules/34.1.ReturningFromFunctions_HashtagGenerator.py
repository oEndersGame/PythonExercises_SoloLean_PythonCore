# Problem:
'''
We are creating our own social network application and need to have a hashtag generator program.
Complete the program to output the input text starting with the hashtag (#).
Also, if the user entered several words, the program should delete the spaces between them.

Sample Input
code sleep eat repeat

Sample Output
#codesleepeatrepeat

Hint
You can use the replace() function to replace the spaces (" ") with empty strings (""). See how it works:
s = "I like pears"
s1 = s.replace("pears", "apricots")
print(s1)

#prints I like apricots

NOTE: Notice that replace() function returns a new string, so you need to declare a new variable for it.

# CODE:

s = input()

def hashtagGen(text):
    text = "#" + s.replace(" ","")
    return text
print(hashtagGen(s))
