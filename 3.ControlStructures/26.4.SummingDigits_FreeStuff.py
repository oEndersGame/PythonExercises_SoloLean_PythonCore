# Problem:
'''
A shop is running a promotion today! If an item's price is an odd number, you get that item for free!

You use a list to store the prices of all items in the shopping cart.
The given code uses a while loop to iterate over the list, calculates the price of all the items in the list, and output the result.

Change the code to skip the odd prices, calculate the sum of only the even prices and outputs the result.

NOTE: Use the continue statement to skip the loop iterations, where the number is odd.

# CODE:

items = [23, 555, 666, 123, 128, 4242, 990]

sum = 0
n = 0
while n < len(items):

    num = items[n]
    n += 1
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue
    sum += num

print(sum)
