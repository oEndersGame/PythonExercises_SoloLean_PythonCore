# Problem:
'''
Imagine a vending machine that sells fruits. Each fruit has its own number, starting from 0.
Write a program for the vending machine, which will take n number as input from the customer and return the fruit with that index.

fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"]

If n< 0 or n>7 (the index of last fruit ), the program outputs "Wrong number".

Sample Input:
2
Sample Output:
banana

NOTE: Remember that the first element of the list has 0 index.
